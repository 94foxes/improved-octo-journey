<!--CSS Grid is a powerful tool that CSS gives to us to easily align items and create two-dimensional layouts. 
Grid and Flexbox are both part of CSS and can both be used 
in similar ways. 
Flexbox created first and has a bit more browser compatibility, 
but not a problem on modern browsers.

LEARN BOTH, but largely down to preference
CSS GRID - overall layout of a website/user interface, headers, cards etc. 
Flexbox - inner elements need to be aligned.

GRID CONTAINERS & GRID ITEMS:
-> Grid container is the element that holds grid items
-> Grid items are direct children of grid containers. 
-> A container is created with display: grid

<div class="grid-container">
  <div>Grid Item 1</div>
    <div>Grid Item 2</div>
      <img src="pic.png" alt="also a grid item">
</div>

TWO-DIMENSIONAL LAYOUTS:
Unlike Flexbox, which is one-dimensional and can be either a 
row or a column, a CSS Grid allows us to create 2D layouts 
with rows AND columns in the same grid. 
Can also span certain rows/columns over eachother - more
sophisticated website layout
